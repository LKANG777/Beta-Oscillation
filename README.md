# Beta-Oscillation
Example code and data for work about Beta Oscillation. 
Beta oscillations and waves in motor cortex can be accounted for by the interplay of spatially-structured connectivity and fluctuating inputs.

main.cpp - C program for the simulation of the network model.

Wave_classification.py - Python program for distinguishing different waves.
